# TODO
- [x] Install project dependencies as Git submodules instead of using CMake to fetch them?
  - [  ] This will reduce CI cache sizes (but might increase checkout).
- [ ] Get version number/release tag from `CMakeLists.txt`/`PROJECT_VERSION`.
- [ ] Refactor `CMakeLists.txt` `release` target to reused all but the `zip`/`tar.gz` parts.
- [ ] Calculate release sha without checkout in `release` job.
- [ ] Tidy up the Git history of `feature/sdl-port`.
- [ ] Explore using CPack for distributing project builds.
- [ ] Merge CMake toolchains?
- [ ] Figure out how to get audio working on WSLg.
- [ ] Get Wayland working on WSLg.
- [x] Disable console in `Release` build.
- [x] Split Docker image into multiple targets for each OS target.
- [x] Make a proper "package" target in CMake instead of using `POST_BUILD` which will not trigger if there are no changes.
- [x] Create build pipeline to build different targets and publish to GH/Releases page.
- [x] Enable splash screen and game restart.
- [x] Attempt to compile for Apple M1/2 processors.
- [x] Install `osxcross` in Docker image without Git submodule?
- [x] Draw lap counter with SDL_ttf.
